# Reddit API Interaction

This project contains Python functions that interact with the Reddit API:

1. `number_of_subscribers`:
    - Takes a subreddit name and returns the number of subscribers for that subreddit.
    - If the subreddit is invalid, it returns 0.

2. `top_ten`:
    - Takes a subreddit name and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts.
    - If the subreddit is invalid, it prints None.

Both functions are written in compliance with PEP 8 guidelines.
